#Etch a Sketch Game

#This game is an implementation of the classic toy, Etch-A-Sketch, using the Python Turtle module.
#Players can use the arrow keys to draw lines on the screen, and use the "c" key to clear the screen and start again.
#The Turtle's movements simulate the mechanical movements of the toy, allowing players to create simple drawings and designs.
#The game continues until the player chooses to close the window.

#Importing libary
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# Set up the turtle and screen
x = Turtle()
screen = Screen()
screen.title("Etch-A-Sketch")

# Define the movement functions
def move_forward():
    x.forward(10)

def move_backward():
    x.backward(10)

def turn_left():
    x.left(10)

def turn_right():
    x.right(10)

def clear():
    x.clear()
    x.penup()
    x.home()  #Call the function back to center (0,0)
    x.pendown()

# Bind the movement functions to keys
screen.onkey(move_forward, "Up")
screen.onkey(move_backward, "Down")
screen.onkey(turn_left, "Left")
screen.onkey(turn_right, "Right")
screen.onkey(clear, "c")

# Start listening for events
screen.listen()

# Keep the window open until the user closes it
screen.mainloop()
