#Turtle Race

#This Python code uses the Turtle graphics library to create a simple turtle racing game.
#The user is prompted to bet on the color of the turtle they think will win the race. 
#The program then generates a group of turtles of different colors and moves them forward by random amounts until one of them crosses the finish line. 
#The winner's color is displayed on the screen and the user is notified if they won or lost their bet. 
#The program also includes a finish line and uses custom fonts and colors to create a visually appealing experience.
